## What is a computer network?

A computer network is a bunch of devices connected together to exchange information — emails, documents, audio/video data — or to share a resource — printers, storages and other physical devices.

Typically, computers in a network are called hosts, while links are the elements that connect them. The picture below displays a very primitive form of network where two hosts are linked together through a physical cable.
