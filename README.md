# Netpractice

The net_practice project is our first networking related project in 42 curriculum. It consists in 10 exercises in which we should configure different small-scale networks into communicating with each other.

The project serves as an introduction to networking concepts, requiring students to solve connectivity issues by properly configuring IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing tables to make networks functional. Each level introduces new challenges and networking concepts, building from basic connectivity to more complex multi-network scenarios.
